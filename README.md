From global carbon trading markets on the Ven Climate Standard to forest and nature reserve conservation using the Proof of Oxygen consensus mechanism, Ven and XRP are set to change the economic system around environmental protection by putting recurring revenue into the hands of those who protect nature, providing an economic incentive to save forest habitat,  the Amazon and even preserve oceans.
